# Footballer-Map
Project for upcoming website/blog. 
Aiming to provide eventually a world map and selectable competitions. 
The map will show how many players from each country have won said competition.
Clicking a country will zoom to that level and show the same for each region in the country.
Clicking again will give a list of the players from that place that have won.
Additional options for choosing a date range.
